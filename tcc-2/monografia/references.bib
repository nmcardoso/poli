   abstract = {In this paper we present the data manipulation facility for a structured English query language (SEQUEL) which can be used for accessing data in an integrated relational data base. Without resorting to the concepts of bound variables and quantifiers SEQUEL identifies a set of simple operations on tabular structures, which can be shown to be of equivalent power to the first order predicate calculus. A SEQUEL user is presented with a consistent set of keyword English templates which reflect how people use tables to obtain information. Moreover, the SEQUEL user is able to compose these basic templates in a structured manner in order to form more complex queries. SEQUEL is intended as a data base sublanguage for both the professional programmer and the more infrequent data base user.},

Aho, Beeri and Ullman made the counterintuitive discovery that there is a relation schema with a valid decomposition into three of its projections without the decomposition being equivalent to a cascade of decompositions, each into two projections. Because of this possibility, there exist bizarre relation schemata that are in fourth normal form but not in PJ/NF. We also discuss issues associated with allowing the union operator.},

The Extended Source Catalog (XSC) embodies both photometric and astrometric whole sky uniformity, revealing large scale structures in the local Universe and extending our view into the Milky Way's dust-obscured ‘Zone of Avoidance’. The XSC represents a uniquely unbiased sample of nearby galaxies, particularly sensitive to the underlying, dominant, stellar mass component of galaxies. The basic properties of the XSC, including photometric sensitivity, source counts, and spatial distribution, are presented here. Finally, we employ a photometric redshift technique to add depth to the spatial maps, reconstructing the cosmic web of superclusters spanning the sky.},

   abstract = {We calculate the expected amplitude of the dipole and higher spherical harmonics in the angular distribution of radio galaxies. The median redshift of radio sources in existing catalogues is z ∼ 1, which allows us to study large-scale structure on scales between those accessible to present optical and infrared surveys, and that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The dipole is a result of two effects which turn out to be of comparable magnitude: (i) our motion with respect to the CMB, and (ii) large-scale structure, parametrized here by a family of cold dark matter power-spectra. We make specific predictions for the Green Bank 1987 (87GB) and Parkes-MIT-NRAO (PMN) catalogues, which in our combined catalogue include ∼40 000 sources brighter than 50 mJy at 4.85 GHz, over about 70 per cent of the sky. For these relatively sparse catalogues both the motion and large-scale structure dipole effects are expected to be smaller than the Poisson shot noise. However, we detect dipole and higher harmonics in the combined 87GB-PMNraw catalogue which are far larger than expected. We attribute this to a 2 per cent flux mismatch between the two catalogues. Ad hoc corrections made in an effort to match the catalogues may suggest a marginal detection of a dipole. To detect a dipole and higher harmonics unambiguously, a catalogue with full sky coverage and ∼106 sources is required. We also investigate the existence and extent of the supergalactic plane in the above catalogues. In a strip of ±10° of the standard supergalactic equator, we find a 3σ detection in PMNraw, but only 1σ in 87GBraw. We briefly discuss the implications of ongoing surveys such as FIRST and NVSS and follow-up redshift surveys.},

SciServer uses a Docker/VM based architecture to provide interactive and batch mode server-side analysis with scripting languages like Python and R in various environments including Jupyter (notebooks), RStudio and command-line in addition to traditional SQL-based data analysis. Users have access to private file storage as well as personal SQL database space. A flexible resource access control system allows users to share their resources with collaborators, a feature that has also been very useful in classroom environments. All these services, wrapped in a layer of REST APIs, constitute a scalable collaborative data-driven science platform that is attractive to science disciplines beyond astronomy.},

Thus, efficient algorithms for accessing and manipulating large sets and sequences will be required to provide acceptable performance. The advent of object-oriented and extensible database systems will not solve this problem. On the contrary, modern data models exacerbate the problem: In order to manipulate large sets of complex objects as efficiently as today's database systems manipulate simple records, query-processing algorithms and software will become more complex, and a solid understanding of algorithm and architectural issues is essential for the designer of database management software. This survey provides a foundation for the design and implementation of query execution facilities in new database management systems. It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and postrelational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set-matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains. © 1993, ACM.

This international Virtual Observatory will allow astronomers to interrogate multiple data centres in a seamless and transparent way, will provide new powerful analysis and visualisation tools within that system, and will give data centres a standard framework for publishing and delivering services using their data. The first step for the IVOA projects is to develop the standardised framework that will allow such creative diversity. Since its inception in June 2002, the IVOA has already fostered the creation of a new international and widely accepted, astronomical data format (VOTable) and has set up technical working groups devoted to defining essential standards for service registries, content description, data access, data models and query languages following developments in the grid community. These new standards and technologies are being used to build science prototypes, demonstrations, and applications, many of which have been shown in international meetings in the past two years. This paper reviews the current status of IVOA projects, the priority areas for technical development, the science prototypes and planned developments.},

Originally developed to address the data processing and analysis needs of the present generation of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments (e.g. BOOMERanG, WMAP), HEALPix can be expanded to meet many of the profound challenges that will arise in confrontation with the observational output of future missions and experiments, including e.g. Planck, Herschel, SAFIR, and the Beyond Einstein CMB polarization probe. In this paper we consider the requirements and constraints to be met in order to implement a sufficient framework for the efficient discretization and fast analysis/synthesis of functions defined on the sphere, and summarise how they are satisfied by HEALPix.},

Deeper DECaLS images (r = 23.6 versus r = 22.2 from SDSS) reveal spiral arms, weak bars, and tidal features not previously visible in SDSS imaging. To best exploit the greater depth of DECaLS images, volunteers select from a new set of answers designed to improve our sensitivity to mergers and bars. Galaxy Zoo volunteers provide 7.5 million individual classifications over 314 000 galaxies. 140 000 galaxies receive at least 30 classifications, sufficient to accurately measure detailed morphology like bars, and the remainder receive approximately 5. All classifications are used to train an ensemble of Bayesian convolutional neural networks (a state-of-the-art deep learning method) to predict posteriors for the detailed morphology of all 314 000 galaxies. We use active learning to focus our volunteer effort on the galaxies which, if labelled, would be most informative for training our ensemble. When measured against confident volunteer classifications, the trained networks are approximately 99 per cent accurate on every question. Morphology is a fundamental feature of every galaxy; our human and machine classifications are an accurate and detailed resource for understanding how galaxies evolve.},

@article{gz2-bias,
   abstract = {The majority of galaxies in the local Universe exhibit spiral structure with a variety of forms. Many galaxies possess two prominent spiral arms, some have more, while others display a many-armed flocculent appearance. Spiral arms are associated with enhanced gas content and star formation in the discs of low-redshift galaxies, so are important in the understanding of star formation in the local universe. As both the visual appearance of spiral structure, and the mechanisms responsible for it vary from galaxy to galaxy, a reliable method for defining spiral samples with different visual morphologies is required. In this paper, we develop a new debiasing method to reliably correct for redshift-dependent bias in Galaxy Zoo 2, and release the new set of debiased classifications. Using these, a luminosity-limited sample of ~18 000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey spiral galaxies is defined, which are then further sub-categorized by spiral arm number. In order to explore how different spiral galaxies form, the demographics of spiral galaxies with different spiral arm numbers are compared. It is found that whilst all spiral galaxies occupy similar ranges of stellar mass and environment, many-armed galaxies display much bluer colours than their two-armed counterparts. We conclude that two-armed structure is ubiquitous in star-forming discs, whereas many-armed spiral structure appears to be a short-lived phase, associated with more recent, stochastic star-formation activity.},

   abstract = {We present the data release for Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2), a citizen science project with more than 16 million morphological classifications of 304 122 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).Morphology is a powerful probe for quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection. The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with mr > 17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original GZ2 project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority (\{greater-than or approximate\}90 per cent) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars and arm curvature.

   abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ∼10 5 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology. © 2008 RAS.},

The bulk of the sample is selected to have mI814W < 23.5, but goes as faint as mI814W < 26.8 for deep images combined over five epochs. The median redshift of the combined samples is 〈 z 〉 = 0.9 ± 0.6, with a tail extending out to z ≃ 4. The GZH morphological data include measurements of both bulge- and disc-dominated galaxies, details on spiral disc structure that relate to the Hubble type, bar identification, and numerous measurements of clump identification and geometry. This paper also describes a new method for calibrating morphologies for galaxies of different luminosities and at different redshifts by using artificially redshifted galaxy images as a baseline. The GZH catalogue contains both raw and calibrated morphological vote fractions for 119 849 galaxies, providing the largest data set to date suitable for large-scale studies of galaxy evolution out to z ~ 1.},

   abstract = {We present quantified visual morphologies of approximately 48 000 galaxies observed in three Hubble Space Telescope legacy fields by the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) and classified by participants in the Galaxy Zoo project. 90 per cent of galaxies have z ≤ 3 and are observed in rest-frame optical wavelengths by CANDELS. Each galaxy received an average of 40 independent classifications, which we combine into detailed morphological information on galaxy features such as clumpiness, bar instabilities, spiral structure, and merger and tidal signatures. We apply a consensus-based classifier weighting method that preserves classifier independence while effectively downweighting significantly outlying classifications. After analysing the effect of varying image depth on reported classifications, we also provide depth-corrected classifications which both preserve the information in the deepest observations and also enable the use of classifications at comparable depths across the full survey.Comparing the Galaxy Zoo classifications to previous classifications of the same galaxies shows very good agreement; for some applications, the high number of independent classifications provided by Galaxy Zoo provides an advantage in selecting galaxies with a particular morphological profile, while in others the combination of Galaxy Zoo with other classifications is a more promising approach than using any one method alone.We combine the Galaxy Zoo classifications of 'smooth' galaxies with parametric morphologies to select a sample of featureless discs at 1 ≤ z ≤ 3, which may represent a dynamically warmer progenitor population to the settled disc galaxies seen at later epochs.},

These data descriptions are captured as numerical vectors that are computationally inexpensive to store and compare. However, the unique characteristics of vectorized data, including high dimensionality and sparsity, demand specialized solutions for efficient storage, retrieval, and processing. This narrative literature review provides an accessible introduction to the fundamental concepts, use-cases, and current challenges associated with vector database management systems, offering an overview for researchers and practitioners seeking to facilitate effective vector data management.},

   abstract = {There are now over 20 commercial vector database management systems (VDBMSs), all produced within the past five years. But embedding-based retrieval has been studied for over ten years, and similarity search a staggering half century and more. Driving this shift from algorithms to systems are new data intensive applications, notably large language models, that demand vast stores of unstructured data coupled with reliable, secure, fast, and scalable query processing capability. A variety of new data management techniques now exist for addressing these needs, however there is no comprehensive survey to thoroughly review these techniques and systems. We start by identifying five main obstacles to vector data management, namely the ambiguity of semantic similarity, large size of vectors, high cost of similarity comparison, lack of structural properties that can be used for indexing, and difficulty of efficiently answering “hybrid” queries that jointly search both attributes and vectors. Overcoming these obstacles has led to new approaches to query processing, storage and indexing, and query optimization and execution. For query processing, a variety of similarity scores and query types are now well understood; for storage and indexing, techniques include vector compression, namely quantization, and partitioning techniques based on randomization, learned partitioning, and “navigable” partitioning; for query optimization and execution, we describe new operators for hybrid queries, as well as techniques for plan enumeration, plan selection, distributed query processing, data manipulation queries, and hardware accelerated query execution. These techniques lead to a variety of VDBMSs across a spectrum of design and runtime characteristics, including “native” systems that are specialized for vectors and “extended” systems that incorporate vector capabilities into existing systems. We then discuss benchmarks, and finally outline research challenges and point the direction for future work.},

   abstract = {Multinomial naive Bayes (MNB) assumes that all attributes (i.e., features) are independent of each other given the context of the class, and it ignores all dependencies among attributes. However, in many real-world applications, the attribute independence assumption required by MNB is often violated and thus harms its performance. To weaken this assumption, one of the most direct ways is to extend its structure to represent explicitly attribute dependencies by adding arcs between attributes. On the other hand, although a Bayesian network can represent arbitrary attribute dependencies, learning an optimal Bayesian network from high-dimensional text data is almost impossible. The main reason is that learning the optimal structure of a Bayesian network from high-dimensional text data is extremely time and space consuming. Thus, it would be desirable if a multinomial Bayesian network model can avoid structure learning and be able to represent attribute dependencies to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel model called structure extended multinomial naive Bayes (SEMNB). SEMNB alleviates the attribute independence assumption by averaging all of the weighted one-dependence multinomial estimators. To learn SEMNB, we propose a simple but effective learning algorithm without structure searching. The experimental results on a large suite of benchmark text datasets show that SEMNB significantly outperforms MNB and is even markedly better than other three state-of-the-art improved algorithms including TDM, DWMNB, and Rw, cMNB.},

Researchers have published many articles in the field of topic modeling and applied in various fields such as software engineering, political science, medical and linguistic science, etc. There are various methods for topic modelling; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is one of the most popular in this field. Researchers have proposed various models based on the LDA in topic modeling. According to previous work, this paper will be very useful and valuable for introducing LDA approaches in topic modeling. In this paper, we investigated highly scholarly articles (between 2003 to 2016) related to topic modeling based on LDA to discover the research development, current trends and intellectual structure of topic modeling. In addition, we summarize challenges and introduce famous tools and datasets in topic modeling based on LDA.},

On the purpose of challenging these problems, we propose a new surrogate-based multiobjective optimization algorithm that does not require a large evaluation budget. It is called Multiobjective Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (MOTPE) and is an extension of the tree-structured Parzen estimator widely used to solve expensive single-objective optimization problems. Our empirical evidences reveal that MOTPE can approximate Pareto fronts of many benchmark problems better than existing methods with a limited budget. In this paper, we discuss furthermore the influence of MOTPE configurations to understand its behavior.},

   abstract = {Machine learning methods have been adopted for various real-world applications, ranging from social networks, online image/video-sharing platforms, and e-commerce to education, healthcare, etc. However, several components of machine learning methods, including data representation, hyperparameter and model architecture, can largely affect their performance in practice. Moreover, the explosions of data scale and model size make the optimization of these components more and more time-consuming for machine learning developers. To tackle these challenges, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims to automate the process of applying machine learning methods to solve real-world application tasks, reducing the time of tuning machine learning methods while maintaining good performance. In this tutorial, we will introduce the main research topics of AutoML, including Hyperparameter Optimization, Neural Architecture Search and Meta-Learning. Two emerging topics of AutoML, DNN-based Feature Generation and Machine Learning Guided Database, will also be discussed as they are important components for real-world applications. For each topic, we will motivate it with examples from industry, illustrate the state-of-the-art methods, and discuss their pros and cons from both perspectives of industry and academy. We will also discuss some future research directions based on our experience from industry and the trends in academy.},
